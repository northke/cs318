    <h1>Meet Pastor Heidi</h1>   
        
        <p>Heidi has
come to us with amazing credentials.
She has a wealth of experience
as a successful pastor, and
has achieved many excellent educational
degrees.
        </p>
        <p>
When we, on the Pastor Nominating
Committee, checked out
her references, people from her
former church congregations said
she was “an outstanding, engaging
preacher,” “good at recruiting
volunteers,” “organized and empowering,”
and “beloved by the congregation.”</p>
            <p>
She has served as a pastor in New York, Florida, Indiana
and Minnesota. She served
nearby Bryn Mawr Church in the
1990s. For 10 years she was senior
minister at Macalester Plymouth
United Church in St. Paul. 
        </p>
        <p>
        In 2011, Heidi left Minnesota when
her husband, Rev. Frank Vardeman,
took a call to become Executive
Presbyter of the Presbytery
of Wabash Valley in northern Indiana. In 2015, when he was
“about to undergo knee surgery,
his bad knees being the result of
years as a champion high school
football player in Georgia, his
legs suddenly “turned to wet
noodles” that could no longer
support him. Tests revealed that
the culprit was a tiny growth entangled
in his spinal cord, compressing
the nerves that control
the lower parts of his body. It
took two neurosurgeries at a Chicago
hospital and 44 days of rehab
before Rev. Frank could return
home. Though the growth
on his spine turned out not to be
cancerous, he is now paralyzed
from the thighs down.” (quotes
from a New York Times on line
article, Turning to Social Media in
Times of Need” by D.H. Jacobs,
May 13, 2015). Later that year he
had six more operations and a
four-month stay at the Courage
Center in Golden Valley. 
        </p>
        <p>
        This “new reality” “came out of
the blue with no warning.” Continuing
in Heidi’s words: “Overnight
he went from being a tall,
strong church leader to a paraplegic
on disability. This was a
huge change for him—and for
me. Suddenly I went from being
the pastor who was the one to
offer help to others to being the
caregiver in need of assistance
and support. The personal challenges
the two of us have faced
have been extraordinary, but so
has been the emotional and spiritual
growth. I feel I have become
a more patient and forgiving person
and believe I would now be a
more thoughtful pastor. 
        </p>
        <p>
        My time away from the pastorate
for the past months while I
cared for Frank gave me a lot of
time to think about the ministry
and me. I have come to appreciate
the pastor’s distinctive role in building community and helping
a congregation move forward
according to particular principles
set out by our faith and in response
to our understanding of
scripture. I have missed the personal
and relational nature of
parish life, getting to know people
of different ages and walks of
life, making hospital visits and
especially sermon preparation
and leading worship. I even miss
session meetings. I am more
grateful now for my vocation and
am eager to ‘get back in the saddle’
as a pastor again.”
